### How to make a clean pull request

- Create an issue or feature request [here](https://github.com/franshej/CustomMatPlot/issues/new).
- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Ensure that your remote repository on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- Create a new branch from the `master` branch.
- Implement your feature or fix the issue.
- Use Github Copilot, ChatGPT, or your favorite linter to check for code smells, architecture issues, or bad logic.
- Format your Cpp code with `ClangFormat` style: `Google`.
- Create a test for your fix, if possible (currently, only manual tests are available).
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, which is the remote `origin`.
- From your fork, open a pull request to the `master` branch.
- 1 approval is required for merging.
